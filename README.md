# Postman API Automation Project

## About this project:

This project automates API testing for the Valentino Artisan Coffee House API using Postman. It includes:

- Test Scripts: A collection of Postman test scripts designed to validate various API request responses (schemas, status codes, data, etc.) [Check them out here!](https://www.postman.com/ederfdz/workspace/api-tester/collection/27786671-71a7dd34-ba00-49ec-9619-cba2dfe84dea
)

- Daily Execution: A GitHub Actions workflow is configured to run these test scripts automatically on a daily basis. This ensures regular validation of the API's functionality and helps catch any regressions.
